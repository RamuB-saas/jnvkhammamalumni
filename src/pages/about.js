        Welcome to the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Palair, Khammam Alumni
        Association! We are a community of former students dedicated to
        fostering connections, supporting each other, and giving back to our
        alma mater.

      <p>
        Our mission is to create a strong network of alumni who can share their
        experiences, provide mentorship, and contribute to the growth and
        development of current students. We believe in the power of education
        and the importance of staying connected with our roots.

        Through various events, initiatives, and outreach programs, we aim to
        make a positive impact on both our alumni community and the school. We
        encourage all former students to join us in this journey of lifelong
        learning and camaraderie.
